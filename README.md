# Python-Hackathon-2019
My submissions for the Python Hackathon conducted in my university.
Members could participate individually or in pairs. Each "team" had to solve at least six questions--two of ten from Part A and four of twelve from Part B. Each part had a specified score per problem (the same for all problems in that part). The team with the most score at the end of five hours wins. 
I won the consolation prize.
